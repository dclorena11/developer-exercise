##Some notes

###Simple Backbone
I tried my best, but for some reason when I try to render my quotes view, it does not display my quotes' attributes. I am open to any feed back or advice you can give regarding the format of my Pageable Collection. It was really hard for me to move forward with the pagination without my attributes appearing on the table.
